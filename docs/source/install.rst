Installation Guide
===================


The easiest way to install ``ffn`` is from the `Python Package Index <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ffn/>`_
using ``pip`` or ``easy_install``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install ffn

Since ffn has many dependencies, we strongly recommend installing the `Anaconda Scientific Python Distribution <https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/>`_. This distribution comes with many of the required packages pre-installed, including pip. Once Anaconda is installed, the above command should complete the installation. 

ffn should be compatible with Python 2.7.
